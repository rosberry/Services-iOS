## Installation

### Depo

[Depo](https://github.com/rosberry/depo) is a universal dependency manager that combines CocoaPods, Carthage and SPM.

You can use Depo to install Layout by adding it to your `Depofile`:
```yaml
carts:
  - kind: github
    identifier: rosberry/services-ios
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. To integrate Layout into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "rosberry/services-ios"
```
